# Five Things App

## Overview

The 5 Things App is designed to help users appreciate the smaller joys in life by listing down five things that make them happy every day.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine

### Prerequisites & System Dependencies

Ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) - 3.4.4
* [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html) - 8.0.3
* PostgreSQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
   
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/five-things.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory

`cd five-things`

3. Install necessary gems

`bundle install`

4. Install PostgreSQL

```
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

### Database Creation

1. Create the database

`rails db:create`

3. Migrate the database

`rails db:migrate`

### Database Initialization

1. Seed the database

`rails db:seed`

### Running Tests

1. To run the complete test suite, execute

```bash
rspec # run all tests
rspec spec/requests/users_spec.rb # run a specific test
```

### Development Server

**Option 1: Using Foreman (recommended for production-like environment)**

Start both Rails server and ngrok simultaneously:

```bash
bin/dev
```

This will start:
- Rails server on `http://localhost:3000`
- ngrok tunnel (URL will be shown in the logs)

**Option 2: Manual setup (recommended for debugging with binding.pry)**

Start Rails server and ngrok separately:

**Terminal 1 - Rails Server:**
```bash
rails s
```

**Terminal 2 - ngrok (for mobile testing):**
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

The ngrok URL will be displayed in Terminal 2 under "Forwarding" (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`, `https://abc123.ngrok-free.dev`, or `https://abc123.ngrok.io`). Use this URL to test the app on your mobile device. Ngrok URLs may end in `.app`, `.dev`, or `.io` depending on your ngrok account. The app is configured to accept all formats. üôåüèª
